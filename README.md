# docker-qt-builder

This container is used to build [Qt](https://www.qt.io) projects.

It includes the following packages:

* qtbase;
* qtquickcontrols2;

Other packages will be added in the future.

This is a WIP, don't used this on production, I created it just to use it in the CI pipeline of personal projects.
